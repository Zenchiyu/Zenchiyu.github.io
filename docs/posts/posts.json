However, an event at my high school showcasing different scientific disciplines changed that.\r\nThis is in this event, at Collège Claparède, that I discovered the concept of Neural Networks. It was explained to us as a black box, taking an image of a dog and spitting out the class label saying whether it’s a dog or a cat, which led to some frustration.\r\nWhy did he not explain how to construct that black box ? How to construct it ?\r\nThese questions led to the start of my journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
